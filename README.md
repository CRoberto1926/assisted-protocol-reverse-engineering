# APRE: Assisted Protocol Reverse Engineering

Assisted Protocol Reverse Engineering, shortly APRE, is a tool aimed at assisting the extraction of protocol specifications based on network traces.

Given a dataset of protocol messages, it extracts, using bioinformatic algorithms and statistical considerations, the (probable) structure of the analyzed protocol.

The tool is written in C++ and it uses Boost libraries.
